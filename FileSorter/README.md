Files with the same extension are placed in the same folder. For PB-Files and images the program tries to categorize them further.
Features:
- for PB files it tries to detect the content (e.g. if it is a DirectX snipped or Toolbar snippet...)
- Images are categorized by the size (thumb,small,medium,big,square) 
- MD5 is used to avoid multiple copies of the same file
